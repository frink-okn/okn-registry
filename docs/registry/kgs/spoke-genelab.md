title: SPOKE GeneLab
description: The spoke-genelab KG complements the spokeokn (SPOKE Open Knowledge
  Network) KG and is designed to integrate omics data from NASA’s Open Science
  Data Repository (OSDR/GeneLab), which hosts results from spaceflight
  experiments. The current release includes transcriptional profiling (RNA-Seq,
  DNA microarray) and epigenomic profiling (DNA methylation) data from model
  organisms flown in space or maintained as ground controls. Differential
  expression and methylation signatures are pre-computed to facilitate
  comparisons between spaceflight and control conditions. Genes from model
  organisms are systematically mapped to their human orthologs, which allows
  integration with SPOKE’s rich network of human biology, including pathways,
  phenotypes, and therapeutic targets. Cell and tissue types are mapped to the
  Cell (CL) and Uber Anatomy Ontology (UBERON) ontology, respectively.
