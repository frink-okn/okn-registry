The BiomarkerKB Knowledge Graph is an interconnected knowledge structure that links biomarkers to diseases, drugs, biological entities, and supporting scientific evidence. The data added from public resources captures the roles of biomarkers (such as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive) and connects information across genes, proteins, metabolites, and therapies, enabling integrated queries and insights for biomarker discovery and translational research.
