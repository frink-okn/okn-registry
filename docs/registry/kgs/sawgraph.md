title: SAWGraph PFAS graph 
description: The Safe Agricultural Products and Water Graph (SAWGraph) is an open knowledge network to monitor and trace PFAS and other contaminants in the nation's food and water systems. The PFAS graph stores data on PFAS observations and releases, describing the samples, the geospatial features they were taken from (e.g. wells, water bodies, facilities, fields), the sampled environmental media (e.g. drinking water, waste water, soil, animal or plant tissue), the specific chemical substances (over 30 different substances) and the measurement values observed. Currently the data covers Maine data (from the EGAD dataset) and data from WaterQualityPortal (WQP) from select other states.
