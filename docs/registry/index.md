| [spoke-genelab](kgs/spoke-genelab/) | SPOKE GeneLab | The spoke-genelab KG complements the spokeokn (SPOKE Open Knowledge Network) KG and is designed to integrate omics data from NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR/GeneLab), which hosts results from spaceflight experiments. The current release includes transcriptional profiling (RNA-Seq, DNA microarray) and epigenomic profiling (DNA methylation) data from model organisms flown in space or maintained as ground controls. Differential expression and methylation signatures are pre-computed to facilitate comparisons between spaceflight and control conditions. Genes from model organisms are systematically mapped to their human orthologs, which allows integration with SPOKE’s rich network of human biology, including pathways, phenotypes, and therapeutic targets. Cell and tissue types are mapped to the Cell (CL) and Uber Anatomy Ontology (UBERON) ontology, respectively. |
| [spoke-okn](kgs/spoke-okn/) | SPOKE-OKN | The spoke-okn (SPOKE Open Knowledge Network) KG is a comprehensive biomedical and environmental health knowledge graph that integrates diverse data across genomics, environmental science, and public health. It encompasses multiple primary entity types, including organisms, geographic locations (from countries to ZIP codes), genes, diseases, chemical compounds, social determinants of health, and environmental contexts. With detailed hierarchical coverage of geographic information, spoke-okn supports spatial analyses of health outcomes, environmental exposures, and socioeconomic factors across a range of geographic scales. |
